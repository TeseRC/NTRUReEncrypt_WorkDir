# NTRUReEncrypt_WorkDir
My working directory of Eclipse NTRUReEncypt project

Using the JAVA Bouncy Castle Crypto library in https://www.bouncycastle.org/about.html
The NTRU crypto system is built in https://github.com/tbuktu/ntru
NTRU public-key cryptosystem, consisting of the encryption scheme NTRUEncrypt and the signature scheme NTRUSign.

On top of NTRU, the NTRUReEncrypt PRE system is built and available in https://github.com/cygnusv/ntrureencrypt

Over NTRUReEncrypt we build our scripts and different implementations to measure performance and limitations.
